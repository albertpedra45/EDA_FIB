On this repository my personal review and analysis of the eda course will be placed.

I will base my analysis on the FIB course as well as MIT's Introduction to Algorithms course.

My goal is to set a basis thinkig procedure on every aspect of the course, with the following explanation placed here. 

The course is founded on theorical analysis of algorithms and also practical implementation. 

First of all, asymptotic costs are the way algorithms efficiency is going to be measured. 
 
Solutions form Jutge.org problems will be presented in a very special way. How to come up with a solution for every problem 
will be discussed, procediments will be implemented and posterior conclusions will be taken.
